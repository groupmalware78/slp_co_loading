#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Starts every app in this repo for local development: Service-Provider
# (admin), Warehouse, api, all three customer-portal instances, and the
# Flutter mobile app on whatever iOS/Android targets are available. Safe
# to re-run — anything already listening on its port (or an already-
# running `flutter run`) is left alone instead of being duplicated.
#
# No monorepo tooling — each app below has its own package.json,
# node_modules, and lock file, and needs its own `npm install` (and, for
# admin/warehouse/api, `npm run db:generate`) on a fresh clone or after
# pulling package.json changes:
#   for d in admin warehouse api customer-portal customer-portal-bhf customer-portal-ids; do
#     (cd "$d" && npm install)
#   done
#
# Only admin, warehouse, and api connect to Postgres directly (each with
# its own Prisma schema against the same database — admin is the sole
# migration authority, the other two mirror it, see the root README).
# The three customer-portal instances and the mobile app have no database
# of their own; they call api/'s REST endpoints instead (plain fetch(),
# no shared client library), so api/ needs to already be up and reachable
# at each instance's ADMIN_API_URL before the others are useful — though
# this script starts all of them regardless of order.
#
# Logs land in logs/<app>.log. Use ./stop-all.sh to tear everything down.
